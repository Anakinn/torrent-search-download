Searching The Pirate Bay, 1337x and ez tv and downloading one file (I need it that way).

Something that I wrote for myself using JSoup.

I learned Java by myself so if I do not follow the certain rules I do not know them.

From pirate bay it is getting first file that has the most seeders. From eztv is getting first file since it is order by seeds, and for 1337 is a little different (they have order by seeds but I'm lazy to rewrite it).

For opening magnet files I used:

See example.

This is written in education purposes because I was curios can I write it.

If you can use it feel free.
